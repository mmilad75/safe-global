# Safe Home Assignment

Congrats! If you've received a link to this repo it means that we think that you might be a good fit for our team.

This is a basic [Expo](https://expo.dev) app with some pre-installed packages, most importantly: **viem, react-native-device-crypto,
react-native-keychain**

## Your task

- create an ethereum private key
- persist it on the device
- read it and display it on the screen

## Things to consider

It's up to you to come up with a solution on how to store the private key securely. Think about the security implications
of storing a private key on a device and how you can mitigate the risks.

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

3. Inside of app/components/Signer.tsx file you'll find 2 functions
    - createPrivateKey
    - revealPrivateKey

place your code inside of these functions. Of course, feel free to create more functions and to organise your code
properly.
Those 2 functions are only the entry points.

## Don't stress

Spend as much time as you want on the task. Generally, we don't expect you to spend more than 2 hours on it, but if you
need more time it's up to you. We are not looking for a perfect solution, but rather for a solution that shows your
thinking process and how you approach the problem.
